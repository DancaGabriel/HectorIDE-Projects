# This is a placeholder for the favicon.ico file.
# In a real application, this would be a binary file containing the icon image data.
# You would typically generate this file using an image editor or a favicon generator tool.

# Since this is a text representation, it's not a valid favicon.
# Replace this with the actual binary data of your favicon.
# For example, you can use a small PNG or ICO image.

# Example (this is NOT a valid favicon, just a reminder):
# The actual content should be binary data, not text.

# You can generate a favicon using online tools like:
# - https://www.favicon.io/
# - https://realfavicongenerator.net/

# Then, replace this file with the downloaded favicon.ico file.
